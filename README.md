Solutions to some nodeschool exercises

Don't mind this repo. 

I'm experimenting with nodeschool.io, both related to teaching related topics in computer science (where I may be looking at some intro exercises), and for brushing up on some parts of JavaScript (where I might be looking at more advanced ones). 

You're unlikely to find anything here you're looking for.
